# Octofet API

## `class Octofet`

Uses: class Spi2Parallel

Create an object of type `Octofet` to communicate with a particular [Octofet board](https://my.amperka.com/modules/octofet).

The one board Octofet includes of 8 power switchers. Take the names of the synonyms: `pin` is a one power switch and `port` is one a device board Octofet.

### `Octofet(uint8_t pinCS, uint8_t devicesCount = 1)`

Constructs a new object of data bus Hardware SPI with arguments:

- `pinCS`: pin Chip Select used for controls the shift-register latch. Any GPIO-pin can be used.
- `devicesCount`: quantity of octofets boards connected in one chain: logical output pin headers of one module to the inputs of another. If the `devicesCount` argument is omitted, it used only one board Octofet.

### `Octofet(uint8_t pinCS, uint8_t pinMOSI, uint8_t pinSCK, uint8_t devicesCount = 1)`

Constructs a new object of data bus Software SPI with arguments:

- `pinCS`: pin Chip Select used for controls the shift-register latch. Any GPIO-pin can be used.
- `pinMOSI`: pin MOSI for sending data to the peripherals. Any GPIO-pin can be used.
- `pinSCK`: pin SCK the clock pulses which synchronize data transmission generated by the master. Any GPIO-pin can be used.
- `devicesCount`: quantity of octofets boards connected in one chain: logical output pin headers of one module to the inputs of another. If the `devicesCount` argument is omitted, it used only one board Octofet.

Difference between Hardware and Software SPI is speed–with software SPI it will run much slower than hardware SPI, but Hardware SPI works only on specific pins: `MOSI`, `MISO`(not used in Octofet) and `SCK`. Use Software SPI only when Hardware SPI pins are used by other devices.

### `void begin(uint8_t* resetValues = NULL)`

Initializes the given interface, prepares the board for communication. The argument `resetValues` states power switchers of all devices by default as 8-bit value. One bit for one power switch: 1 is turn-on and 0 is turn-off. If `resetValues` argument is adjusted, then when calling method `reset()`, power switchers sets value by `resetValues`. If `resetValues` argument is omitted — power switchers sets is turn-off.

Important, call this method at least once, in your `setup()`.

### `void digitalPinWrite(uint8_t pin, bool value, uint8_t device = 0)`

Sets state (turn-on or turn-off) for one power switch. Function arguments:

- `pin`: ordinal number power switch on device. Range is from `0` to `7`.
- `value`: states selected power switch. Values (turn-on or turn-off) may be switch is different data types: `HIGH` or `LOW` / `true` or `false` / `1` or `0`.
- `device`: ordinal number of device on the bus. Range is from `0` to `n - 1`, where `n` last number device. If the `device` argument is omitted, it used only one board Octofet.

### `void digitalPortWrite(uint8_t value, uint8_t device = 0)`

Sets state (turn-on or turn-off) for all power switches. Function arguments:

- `value`: 8-bit value for all of 8 power switchers. One bit for one power switch: 1 is turn-on and 0 is turn-off. Use option value is `ALL` to selected and sets state of all power switchers.
- `device`: ordinal number of device on the bus. Range is from `0` to `n - 1`, where `n` last number device. Use option value is `ALL` to selected and sets state of all devices. If the `device` argument is omitted, it used only one board Octofet.

### `bool digitalPinRead(uint8_t pin, uint8_t device = 0)`

Reads state (turn-on or turn-off) for one power switch of the device. Returns `true` or `false`. Function arguments:

- `pin`: ordinal number power switch on device. Range is from `0` to `7`.
- `device`: ordinal number of device on the bus. Range is from `0` to `n - 1`, where `n` last number device. If the `device` argument is omitted, it used only one board Octofet.

### `uint8_t digitalPortRead(uint8_t device = 0)`

Reads state (turn-on or turn-off) for all power switches of the device. Returns 8-bit value for all of 8 power switchers. One bit for one power switch: 1 is turn-on and 0 is turn-off. Function argument `device`: ordinal number of device on the bus. Range is from `0` to `n - 1`, where `n` last number device. If the `device` argument is omitted, it used only one board Octofet.

### `void reset()`

Resets values all power switchers of all devices to default state.

- If `resetValues` argument in constructs `Octofet` is adjusted, power switchers sets value by `resetValues`.
- If `resetValues` argument is omitted — power switchers sets is turn-off.
